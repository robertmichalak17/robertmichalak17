# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 22-year-old student of Electronics and Telecommunications. I have experience in creating websites, where I designed and developed responsive web pages. Additionally, I have experience in developing applications in C++ and Python, and I am actively enhancing my skills in data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI).

## Below are some examples of my previous projects.
